######## SIM configuration ###########

# Commenting out 'sim.[internal|external].[apn|user|password]'
# configuration parameter (see below) will have precedence over
# system-parameter (NOR). Further, empty values for either of the parameters
# is valid.
#
# The 'apn' should be specified in the format '[<auth-type>:]<apn-name>', where
# <auth-type> (authentication type) can either be 'PAP', 'CHAP' or 'NONE'. If
# <auth-type> is included, a ':' need to be specified as well.
# If no <auth-type> is specified 'NONE' will be assumed, ignoring the user
# and password parameter when setting up the data context for the connection.
#
# The 'sim.[internal|external].[state]' indicates if the sim should be used
# during execution. Possible values:
#  auto
#      decide based on which hardware variant modemd is executed on - if sim
#      is mounted at all. The sim is only probed for usage if it is mounted as
#      indicated by the hardware properties.
#  enable
#      enables the sim for usage. If the sim is not mounted (as indicated by the
#      hardware properties) the configuration will be forced to 'disable'.
#  disable
#      disables the sim
# NOTE: if both internal and external are set to 'disable' modemd will
# fallback to internal sim and disables external!

### Internal sim (eSIM) ###

# Uncomment to set the state of the sim: auto, enabled, disabled (see above),
# default: auto

# Uncomment to override APN system parameter

# Uncomment to override APN user parameter
#sim.internal.user = tbmvcm

# Uncomment to override APN password parameter
#sim.internal.password = connect


### External sim (simcard) ###

# Uncomment to set the state of the sim: auto, enabled, disabled (see above),
# default: auto
#sim.external.state = auto

# Uncomment to override APN system parameter
#sim.external.apn = PAP:m2m.man

# Uncomment to override APN user parameter
#sim.external.user = tbmvcm

# Uncomment to override APN password parameter
#sim.external.password = connect

# Used to override the PIN for an external SIM card. NOTE: this will not have
# any effect on the PIN used for the eSIM (internal SIM)
#sim.external.pin = 8486



######## Antenna diagnostics configuration ###########

# antenna handler execution frequency in seconds, default 10
# Defines how often the RSSI will be queried from the modem (AT+CSQ).
# antenna.freq = 10

# force Modem antenna detection every x amount of iterations (see antenna.freq).
# If antenna.freq = 10 (sec) and antenna.force_check_interval = 3, antenna
# detection will  be trigger every 30 seconds.
# Default value is 3
# antenna.force_check_interval = 3

# Set minimum rssi threshold used for triggering Modem antenna detection
# (AT+UANTR) - default 10 (-90.5dBm)
# antenna.rssi_threshold = 10


######## misc configuration ###########

# In order to not looping with a modem reset, max_modem_reset can be set.
# The modem will be reset in cases which cannot be recovered, e.g.
# AT port could not be opened in time or the modem crashed during operation.
# Default value: 10
# max_modem_reset = 10

# nw_search_reattach_timer: network search re-attach timer is used to control
# when a COPS=2 (not registered) and COPS=0 (try registering) cycle should be
# triggered, when the modem is search for network. This value is specified in
# seconds.
# Unit: seconds
# Default value: 120
#nw_search_reattach_timer = 120

# nw_search_modem_reset_timer: in case the modem was never able to attach to a
# network even after x re-attach cycles (see nw_search_reattach_timer), the
# modem should be reset. This should be specified in seconds
# Unit: seconds
# Default value: 1800
#nw_search_modem_reset_timer = 1800

# Maximum number of SIM Card communication errors allowed before resetting
# the modem.
#max_sim_errors = 5

# Maximum number of modem resets before sendind a Internal HW DTC:
#max_modem_resets_before_dtc = 5

# Timeout to restart modem when no data is detected:
# Unit: minutes
# Default value: 15
#modem_restart_timeout = 15

# Note: Changes to will be used if SIGHUP is sending to the process.
# default: NOTICE
