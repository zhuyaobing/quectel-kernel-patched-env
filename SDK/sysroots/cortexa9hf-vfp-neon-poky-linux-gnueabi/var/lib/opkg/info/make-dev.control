Version: 3.81-r1
Description: GNU tool that controls the build process - Development files
 Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
 non-source files of a program from the program's source files.  Make gets
 its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the
 makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it
 from other files.  This package contains symbolic links, header files,
 and related items necessary for software development.
