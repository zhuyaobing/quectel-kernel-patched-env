Description: XTrans: X Transport library - Development files
 The X Transport Interface is intended to combine all system and transport
 specific code into a single place.  This API should be used by all
 libraries, clients and servers of the X Window System. Use of this API
 should allow the addition of new types of transports and support for new
 platforms without making any changes to the source except in the X
 Transport Interface code.  This package contains symbolic links, header
 files, and related items necessary for software development.
