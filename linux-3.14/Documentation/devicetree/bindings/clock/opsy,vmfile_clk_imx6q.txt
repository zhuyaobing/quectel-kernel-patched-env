* Clock bindings for P4 Linux clock tree virtualization on Freescale i.MX6 Quad

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "opsy,p4-clk-imx6q"
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>
- file_name: Should contain the file name of the file provider driver

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.  See include/dt-bindings/clock/imx6qdl-clock.h
for the full list of i.MX6 Quad and DualLite clock IDs.

Examples:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/imx6qdl-clock.h>

clks: ccm {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-ccm";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	provider-filename = "imx_clk_fp:/vclock";
};

uart1: serial@02020000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-uart", "fsl,imx21-uart";
	reg = <0x02020000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 26 0x04>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_UART_IPG>, <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_UART_SERIAL>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
	status = "disabled";
};

In general, the native device tree with an overlay is used for P4 Linux
DirectIO. In this case, you already have a device tree node for the ccm as
follows. Overriding the compatibility string is sufficient for using clock
tree virtualization.

clks: ccm@020c4000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-ccm";
	reg = <0x020c4000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 87 0x04 0 88 0x04>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

&clks {
	compatible = "opsy,p4-clk-imx6q";
	provider-filename = "imx_clk_fp:/vclock";
}
